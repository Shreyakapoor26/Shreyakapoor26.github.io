      <h1>Healthcare Access, Affordability, and Outcomes Across the United States</h1>
      <h2>Health Care Access</h2>
      <p>Access to healthcare is a fundamental right for all individuals, but unfortunately, it remains a significant problem in the United States (Gaffney et al., 2017). Healthcare costs and insurance availability vary greatly across states, making it difficult for individuals to access the care they need (Rakshit et al., 2023). Moreover, health outcomes vary by state, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of healthcare access and outcomes across the country (Gordon, 2022). In recent years, the cost of healthcare has also become a significant barrier to accessing care, with many individuals delaying or forgoing necessary medical services due to high costs (Rakshit et al., 2023).</p>
      <p>Healthcare costs are a significant reason several Americans are not receiving the care that they need. The project aims to understand and address these challenges by creating a narrative visualization that provides users with information on healthcare access, medical debt, and health outcomes across states. By doing so, we hope to promote greater transparency in healthcare data and enable policymakers to make informed decisions regarding healthcare policy.</p>
      <p>The visualizations created in this narrative provide important insights into the distribution of health outcomes, disparities, funding, access, and utilization across the US by state. These visualizations can serve as a powerful tool to raise awareness of health-related disparities and inform policy development aimed at reducing these disparities. However, further research is needed to better understand the factors contributing to these disparities and to identify effective interventions to address them.</p>      
      <p class="quote">"The first wealth is health." - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p> 
      <p>Despite spending more than the national average per capita on healthcare, many states still have higher rates of chronic medical conditions, medical debt compared, and worse health outcomes and access. For example, Nebraska, for instance, spends almost $400 more per capita on healthcare but does not have more than half the mental, dental, and primary care providers needed to serve its population.
